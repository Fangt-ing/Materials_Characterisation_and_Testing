# 8 bit RAM design and simulation

This is a project that uses different tools to simulate 8 bit RAM working mechanisms, including:

- circuit design via [falstad](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/).
- HDL implementation for wave diagram with [Active-HDL Student Edition - FPGA Simulation](https://www.aldec.com/en/products/fpga_simulation/active_hdl_student).
- Power consumption simulation with [AIM-Spice](http://www.aimspice.com/).
